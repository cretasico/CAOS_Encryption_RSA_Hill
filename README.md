CAOS 2.0 - Asymmetric Encryption Application

CAOS 2.0 is a .NET application developed in 2010 for asymmetric encryption and decryption of plain text files using both Hill Cipher and RSA algorithms. This project leverages public and private key pairs for secure data handling, with a foundation in modular arithmetic, Euclidean algorithms, modular exponentiation, cryptograms, and linear programming.

> **Note**: This code was originally written in Spanish, and I am currently working on migrating it to C# using Telerik. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. For more details on this work, you can visit my blog at [https://lapausa.org/tesis-bachiller/](https://lapausa.org/tesis-bachiller/).

### Features
- **Hill Cipher & RSA Algorithms**: Implements robust encryption algorithms for secure data transfer.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt text data.
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Integrates modular arithmetic and Euclidean algorithms for encryption logic.

This project is ideal for those interested in cryptography, encryption algorithms, and .NET-based applications.
